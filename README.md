# CSV to Excel parser
GUI based python program to parse csv files to excel files.
It will take in any CSV file that has a semicolon as a delimator and parse it to an Excel file.

This project contains an example CSV called "test.csv" that can be used to create an example Excel file.

The GUI right now is pretty plain and not very pretty. An update is coming in the future.

In order to run the program you need:

*Python3

To startup switch to the directory you cloned the repository to and run __python3 Main.py__

This will launch the program
